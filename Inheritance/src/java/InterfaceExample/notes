The interface body can contain abstract methods, default methods, and static methods.

Default methods are defined with the default modifier, and static methods with the static keyword.

All these methods are public by default, so you may not write public with them.

Fish class is implementing IKiller and IFly interfaces, so multi inheritance achieved.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

1) Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods while Interface can have only abstract methods.
2) Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance.	Interface supports multiple inheritance.
3) Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables.	Interface has only static and final variables.
4) Abstract class can have static methods, main method and constructor.	Interface can't have static methods, main method or constructor.
5) Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface.	Interface can't provide the implementation of abstract class.
