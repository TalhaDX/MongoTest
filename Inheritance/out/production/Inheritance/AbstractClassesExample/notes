Abstract class can not be instantiated

abstract class is like a blue print for extended classes.

Also, all extending classes should implement all abstract methods of base class.

There can be non abstract methods in base class.

Non abstract methods can be overridden in child classes.

Child class can  not create its own method. It can only only use base class methods.

New abstract method can not be included in child class, otherwise make the class abstract too.
